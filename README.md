# Dopascript

Dopascript is a lightweight scripting language interpreter for
embedded use in .NET applications. It's built from scratch without any
external dependency.

## Usage

To reference `dopascript.dll` after build it from source.

Alternatively, you can just copy `src/dopascript/*.cs` source code to include in
your application. Since Dopascript code base is small.
